# extreme-precipitation-gnn
I did extreme precipitation events prediction in Bangladesh using remote sensing and ERA5 data from Google Earth Engine (GEE), used Google Cloud Storage (GCS) for big geospatial data handling, used Temporal Fusion Tranformer and Spatio-temporal Graph Neural Network for model building and GraphLIME for explainable AI.
